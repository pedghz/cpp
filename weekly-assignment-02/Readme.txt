Class and object differences:

	At first we should say that an object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default in the class.




What is public interface?
What is private interface? 

	They are access modifiers and help us implement Encapsulation (or information hiding). They tell the compiler which other classes should have access to the field or method being defined.
	private - Only the current class will have access to the field or method.

	public - Any class can refer to the field or call the method.
